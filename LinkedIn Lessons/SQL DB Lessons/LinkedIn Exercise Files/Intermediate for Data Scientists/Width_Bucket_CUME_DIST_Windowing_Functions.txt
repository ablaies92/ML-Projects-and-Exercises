-- more windowing functions: width_bucket and cume_dist (rankings with percentages)
-- the width bucket allows you to essentially bin observations/build a histogram
-- first value is the column, second is the min salary, third value is the max value, and 10 is the # of bins
select
	department_id, 
	last_name, 
	salary,
	width_bucket(salary, 0, 150000, 10)

-- cum distribution example
-- when using the round function initially as round(cume_dist() over (order by salary desc) * 100, 2)
-- you get an error: function round(double precision, integer) does not exist
-- cum distribution function returns a double precision, but it needs to be numeric
-- in order to do this, just use the :: numeric call which is effectively like a cast in microsoft sql server
